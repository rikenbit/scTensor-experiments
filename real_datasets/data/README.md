# How to prepare the real datasets

## Human_Germline_Female
### 1. Gene expression matrix
We downloaded some gene expression related files (e.g. GSM2306011_F_5W_embryo1_and_2_gene_expression.txt) from GEO (GSE86146).

### 2. Celltype label vector
We downloaded the corresponding supplemental file mmc2.xlsx (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28457750) and extracted the table into a CSV file (Cluster_Germline.txt).

### 3. Ligand-Receptor pairs used in the original paper
We listed the L-R pairs in Figure 7.


## Human_Fetal_Kidney
### 1. Gene expression matrix
We downloaded some gene expression related files (e.g. GSM3300889_FetalKidney_Run1865_87days.txt.txt) from GEO (GSE109205).

### 2. Celltype label vector
We contacted with the authors and received the correspondance table between the cellular barcodes, 2D coordinates of t-SNE, and cell types (FK_TSNE_co-ordinates.dms, FK_FirstClusterNames.txt, and FK_Barcodes_FirstClustering.txt).

### 3. Ligand-Receptor pairs used in the original paper
We downloaded the corresponding table in Figure S4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30166318).


## Human_NicotinehESCs_Nicotine
### 1. Gene expression matrix
We downloaded some gene expression related files (e.g. GSM3573650_N_mat) from GEO (GSE125416).

### 2. Celltype label vector
We contacted with the authors and received the correspondance table between the cellular barcodes, 2D coordinates of t-SNE, and cell types (tSNE.txt).

### 3. Ligand-Receptor pairs used in the original paper
We downloaded the corresponding supplemental file mmc7.xlsx (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827876) and extracted the table into a CSV file (crossTalks.txt).


## Mouse_Uterus
### 1. Gene expression matrix
We downloaded a gene expression related file (GSM3320143_WT_Uterus_out_gene_exon_tagged.dge.txt) from GEO (GSE118180).

### 2. Celltype label vector
We contacted with the authors and received the correspondance table between the cellular barcodes, 2D coordinates of t-SNE, and cell types (Uterus_metadata.txt).

### 3. Ligand-Receptor pairs used in the original paper
We listed the L-R pairs in Figure 6 (Circus plot, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872674/).
